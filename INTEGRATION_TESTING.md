# Tardigrade-ci Integration Testing

The tardigrade-ci `Makefile` provides targets to facilitate
integration testing of terraform modules.  The testing can be manual or
automated; if automated, a mock AWS stack is provided by `LocalStack` and `moto`.

This document describes the integration-specific `Makefile` targets and
the environment variables to customize those targets.  In addition,
the steps to execute a test are described, as are the potential CI/CD
changes to incorporate automated integration testing.

## Integration test-specific targets and environment variables

| Target name      | Description |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| mockstack/pytest | From within a Docker container, invoke `pytest` to execute the integration tests. |
| mockstack/up     | Start up a Docker container running the mock AWS stack. |
| mockstack/down   | Bring down the Docker container running the mock AWS stack. |
| mockstack/clean  | Bring down the Docker container running the mock AWS stack, then remove the docker image. |
| terraform/pytest | Invoke `pytest` to execute the integration tests. The mock AWS stack must be started before using this `Makefile` target. |

Defaults:

* `LocalStack` and `moto` are used for the mock AWS stack, with moto serving
ports for services not yet suported by `LocalStack`.  However, there is an
option ("only-moto") to specify that only `moto` ports be used.
* The Terraform modules used for the integration tests are expected to
be located in the directory `tests` off the repo\'s root directory.

### Environment variables

| Environment variable             | Default value |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| INTEGRATION_TEST_BASE_IMAGE_NAME | $(basename $PWD)-integration-test |
| ONLY_MOTO                        | False; adds "--only-moto" to PYTEST_ARGS |
| PYTEST_ARGS                      | |
| TERRAFORM_PYTEST_DIR             | $PWD/tests/terraform/pytest |

### Arguments to the automation script

These are values that can be specified through the environment variable
PYTEST_ARGS.

| Command line option | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| --nomock            | Use AWS, not mocked AWS services.  Takes precedence over the "--only-moto" option. |
| --alternate-profile | Configure an alternate profile in addition to default profile |
| --only-moto         | Use moto ports only for mock AWS services |
| --tf-dir=TF_DIR     | Directory of Terraform files under test; default: './tests' |

## Executing a Terraform test

The tardigrade-ci `Makefile` expects Terraform test modules to be under
the repo's `tests` directory.  There can be multiple sets of tests, each
under their own `tests` subdirectory.

If a test requires an initial test setup, then those Terraform "test setup"
files should be placed in the directory `prereq` under that test\'s
subdirectory.  For example:

```
.
├── tests
│   ├── create_all
│   │   ├── main.tf
│   │   └── prereq
│   │       └── main.tf
│   ├── create_groups
│   │   ├── main.tf

...
```

The `prereq` approach solves the problem where the top-level module has a
count/for_each dependency on the supporting resources being created in
the test.  It creates two terraform state files, one for the prereq and
one for the test config.

To verify that a Terraform test will work, bring up the default AWS mock
stack (`LocalStack`) first, then execute the test:

```bash
make mockstack/up
make terraform/pytest

# To execute a specific set of tests, use the "-k" option and a string
# that will pattern match on the desired subdirectory name.  The "-k"
# option also allows booleans, e.g., "not" or "or".
#
# The following will match on the subdirectory "create_groups".
make terraform/pytest PYTEST_ARGS="-k groups"

# When testing is complete:
make mockstack/clean
```

Alternatively, in lieu of running `make mockstack/up`, LocalStack can be
run from the command line in a separate window. This will provide you with
a running log, although you could view the docker log (with no debugging)
when using `make mockstack/up`.

```
pip install localstack

# Most of the AWS services are started here, but the list can be tailored
# to just the ones needed for the test.
DEBUG=1 SERVICES=ec2,iam,sts,s3,kms,cloudformation,cloudwatch,events,lambda,route53,ssm,sns,sqs,glue,dynamodb \
localstack start

# Wait for a LocalStack to issue the "Ready" message before starting a test.
# To exit LocalStack, type Ctrl-C.
```

## Potential CI/CD changes 

These are suggested changes and may not apply to all repos:

1.  If the repo currently does not contain or use Python scripts,
    update `.gitignore` to add:

```bash
# Caching directory created by pytest.
tests/__pycache__/
```

2.  For a Travis workflow, logic similar to the following can be added
    to the `.travis.yml` file:

```bash
- stage: test
  name: Terraform Integration Tests
  install:
    - make mockstack/up
  script: make mockstack/pytest
  after_script: make mockstack/clean
```
